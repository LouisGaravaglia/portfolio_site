## Purpose

This project was created to showcase my personal projects and professional work. 


## Design

I wanted to have a simple and intuitive design that put the emphasis on the project to drive interest and provide options to view the project and GitHub site. I designed it with a mobile-first approach to breakdown the content to the essentials and added stretch goals when viewport size allowed it.

## Tech Stack

HTML5 | CSS3 | React
